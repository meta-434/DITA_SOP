\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Some very good content here, and your organization works. You will probably scare users away when, in your introduction, announce that "the machine operation is fairly simple, but requires the operator to perform a lot of prep and cleanup." A lot is a pretty vague statement, and it should be phrased in more user-friendly ways. You need warnings! You ask the users to chop fruit finely with a knife, and there are no warnings surrounded those steps. And we do need images. The SOP seems too serious without them (and a little boring for the intended audience of students who want ice cream). Grade: 82/100. Plus 5 extra points: 87 final }
