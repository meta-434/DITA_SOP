Read over the ingredients to the recipe, gather them, making sure you have measured the amounts of each ingredient beforehand for simplicity. You’ll also need to make sure that the freezer bowl you use to make the ice cream is freezer temperature. This relies on the user before you replacing the bowl when they’re done, but it’s important to note that you can’t make ice cream with this machine if the bowl isn’t freezer temperature. Once the freezer bowl is removed from the freezer, it’ll rapidly warm so only take the freezer bowl out when you’re ready to make ice cream.</p>
