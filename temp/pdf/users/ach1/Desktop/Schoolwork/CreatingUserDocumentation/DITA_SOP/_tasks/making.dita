                making process, the volume of the ingredients will increase. Be sure to not allow
                the ice cream mixture to overflow. If, during the ice cream making process, you see
                the bowl begin to overflow, press the start/stop button, lift the lid, and remove
                some of the ice cream. This minimizes the amount of mess the machine creates and
                decreases clean-up time.</note>
